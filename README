# Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker

A real-time cryptocurrency price tracking application built with C++ for the Advanced C++ course final project.

## Project Description

This application allows users to track cryptocurrency prices in real-time, maintain a personal watchlist, and monitor 24-hour price changes. The app demonstrates advanced C++ concepts including multithreading, STL containers, file I/O, and modern UI development.

## Features

- **Real-time Price Updates**: Fetches live cryptocurrency prices every 30 seconds
- **Personal Watchlist**: Add/remove coins to track your favorites
- **Search & Filter**: Quickly find specific cryptocurrencies
- **Price Change Indicators**: Color-coded 24h changes (green = up, red = down)
- **Persistent Storage**: Watchlist automatically saves and loads
- **Multi-threaded**: Non-blocking UI with background price updates

## Technologies & Libraries

### STL Components
- `std::vector` - Dynamic arrays for coin storage
- `std::unordered_map` - Fast key-value storage for coin data
- `std::fstream` - File I/O for watchlist persistence
- `std::filesystem` - Directory and file management
- `std::thread` - Background thread for periodic updates
- `std::mutex` - Thread-safe data access
- `std::atomic` - Lock-free thread synchronization

### Third-Party Libraries
- **ImGui** - Immediate mode GUI framework for the user interface
- **nlohmann/json** - JSON parsing for API responses
- **WinHTTP** - Windows native HTTP client for API communication

### API
- **CoinGecko API** (or CoinCap API) - Free cryptocurrency price data

## Building the Project

### Requirements
- Visual Studio 2019 or later
- Windows 10/11
- C++17 or higher

### Build Steps
1. Open `CryptoTracker.sln` in Visual Studio
2. Set configuration to **Debug** or **Release**
3. Build Solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
4. Run - Start Debugging (F5)

## Course Requirements Met

- **STL Usage**: vector, unordered_map, fstream, filesystem  
- **Threading**: std::thread with background price updates  
- **Synchronization**: std::mutex and std::atomic for thread safety  
- **File I/O**: Watchlist persistence using fstream  
- **Third-Party Libraries**: ImGui, JSON, WinHTTP  
- **HTTP Client**: WinHTTP for API communication  
- **User Interface**: ImGui-based interactive UI  

## Implementation Details

### Threading Architecture
- Main thread: UI rendering (ImGui)
- Background thread: Price updates every 30 seconds
- Mutex protection: All shared data access is synchronized
- Atomic flags: Thread-safe communication (stop signal, connection status)

### Data Flow
1. Background thread fetches JSON from API
2. Parse JSON and update coin prices
3. Lock mutex before modifying shared data
4. UI reads data (with mutex lock) and displays
5. User interactions (add/remove) modify data safely

### Why WinHTTP?
- Is native to Windows (no external dependencies)
- Has built-in HTTPS/SSL support
- Is professionally used in Windows applications
- Simplified the build process
